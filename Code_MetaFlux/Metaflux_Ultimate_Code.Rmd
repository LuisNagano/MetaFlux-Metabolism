# Comparative Metabolic Flux Analysis between Human and Mouse Models

## Introduction

This notebook presents a comparative analysis of metabolic fluxes between human adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) samples and a mouse BPCre tumor model. The analysis involves calculating metabolic reaction activity scores (MRAS), computing metabolic fluxes, and performing comparative analyses across different metabolic pathways and subsystems.
